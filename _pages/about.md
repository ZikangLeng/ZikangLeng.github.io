I am a third/final year Undergrad student with the College of Computing double majoring in Computer Science and Physics at
Georgia Institute of Techology, Atlanta. I am advised by [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz)
and [Prof. Hyeokhyen Kwon](https://kwonvitallab.github.io/members/hyeok-kwon.html).

[My CV can be found here](../files/Resume.pdf)

## Research

My research lies at the intersection of computer vision and ubiquitous computing. A significant portion of my research focuses on generating synthetic/virtual sensor data from videos and texts to augment existing datasets. This approach facilitates more robust and generalizable model training. Additionally, I've delved into sign language recognition, collaborating with [Prof. Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thad-starner) and technologies for diabetes management in collaboration with [Prof. Rosa Arriaga](https://sites.google.com/view/riarriaga/home?authuser=0).
